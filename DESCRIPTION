Description: `neighbor` gets and visualizes the neighbors of a spatial object 
    (area objects) that has at least one point (or vertex) in common, but no intersection. 
    This package uses the `poly2nb` function from the `spdep` package with the
    contiguity neighborhood type: queen and rook.
