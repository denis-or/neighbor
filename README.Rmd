## Overview

`{neighbor}` gets and visualizes the neighbors of a spatial object (area objects) 
that has at least one point (or vertex) in common, but no intersection. 
This package uses the `poly2nb` function from the `spdep` package with the
contiguity neighborhood type: queen and rook.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("denis-or/neighbor")
```

## Example

In this example, we are going to use the `geobr` package to get spatial data for 
Roraima, northern Brazil.

```{r}
library(neighbor)
library(geobr)
```


```{r}
rr <- geobr::read_municipality("RR")
```


Now we get the neighbors with the `get_neighbor` function:

```{r}
nb <- neighbor::get_neighbor(shapefile = rr, tipo = "Queen")
```

In the next step, we will visualize the map with the connections between the 
municipalities. Note that we have added the ggtitle element from the `ggplot`
package to the function.

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width= 12, fig.height= 7}
neighbor::view_connections(nb) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Neighborhood of the municipalities of Roraima.")
```



We will also look at the neighboring municipalities named on the map.

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.width= 12, fig.height= 7}
neighbor::view_neighbor(nb) +
  ggplot2::ggtitle("Neighboring municipalities of Roraima.")
```
